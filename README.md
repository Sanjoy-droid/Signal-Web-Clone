- **Git:** Git version control system is used for managing and tracking changes to the project codebase, facilitating collaboration and code management among team members.

- **GitHub:** GitHub is utilized as the hosting platform for the project repository, enabling version control, collaboration, and code review workflows.

- **npm:** npm is used as the package manager for installing, managing, and updating project dependencies, providing access to a vast ecosystem of JavaScript libraries and tools.

- **RESTful API:** The application follows the REST architectural style for designing API endpoints, ensuring a standardized approach to resource management and interaction.
